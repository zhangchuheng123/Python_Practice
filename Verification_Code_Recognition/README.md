# Description

The code is quite simple where the setup process was troublesome. PyCharm can't install PIL automatically - it can only be installed in Terminal. Tesseract installation was interupted by strange errors - they can be resolved by updating Homebrew.

Homebrew is a package control tool for Mac OSX, whereas PIP is a package control tool for Python.
